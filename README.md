# begin-res
This repo is intended to be a guide to some useful resources for new software developers to find info on the tools used to code.

## editor
In order to write code you need something to write code in. I use vim so the resources I can recommend are very VIM specific

The best way to get started on vim is to play [VIM Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
I have also created a [basic cheatsheet](./vim-notes.md)  

## Git basics
This (Learn Git Branching)[http://learngitbranching.js.org/] gives you all the info on how to use git that you would need in a very clean and simple format.
